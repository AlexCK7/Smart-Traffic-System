üåê Smart Traffic System
The Smart Traffic System is a responsive and interactive dashboard designed to monitor, filter, and analyze real-time traffic data. Using AI-powered object detection and visualization tools, the system processes traffic information to identify objects such as cars, pedestrians, and cyclists, along with their confidence levels at specific timestamps. These insights can inform safety policies, urban planning decisions, and trend analysis, making the project highly valuable for governments, companies, and urban planners. The system also demonstrates the potential for scaling into smart city infrastructure.

The project leverages React.js for the front end, providing a dynamic and responsive user experience. It is built with scalability in mind, enabling future integrations like IoT devices and live camera feeds for real-time data acquisition.

üåü Features
Real-Time Visualization: Displays object detection trends and confidence levels through graphs and tables.
Detection Logs: A searchable table containing timestamped data for traffic objects and their confidence scores.
Interactive Design: Optimized for both desktop and mobile use.
Scalability: Demonstrates potential for integration into larger systems with predictive modeling and alert generation.
üõ†Ô∏è Setting Up the Project
To set up the project, you need a working installation of Node.js (preferably the LTS version). Follow these steps to clone, set up, and run the project locally:

Prerequisites
Install Node.js (LTS version recommended).
Clone the repository from GitHub.
Installation
Clone the repository:
**Copy code to Terminal*
git clone https://github.com/AlexCK7/Smart-Traffic-System.git
cd Smart-Traffic-System/traffic-frontend
Install the dependencies:
**Copy code*
npm install
Running the Application
Start the development server:

**Copy code to Terminal*
npm start
This will launch the app at http://localhost:3000.

Build for production:

**Copy code to Terminal*
npm run build
This generates a build folder containing minified assets, ready for deployment.

üöÄ Deployment
The application can be deployed using platforms like:

GitHub Pages
Netlify
Vercel

Example: Deploying with Netlify
Connect your GitHub repository to Netlify.
Specify the build command:
**Copy code to Terminal*
npm run build
Set the deployment folder to build.
üéØ Usage
Once the project is running, users can:

View Interactive Dashboards: Analyze trends in object detection (e.g., cars, pedestrians, cyclists) using visual graphs and logs.
Search Logs: Filter through traffic events by object type, timestamp, or confidence level.
Generate Insights: Use the data to improve decision-making on urban planning, safety laws, and activity monitoring.
üöÄ Future Enhancements
This project is a foundation for:

Real-Time Data Integration: Live camera feeds or IoT sensors for continuous updates.
AI-Powered Analytics: Predictive models to forecast trends and detect anomalies.
Mobile Access: A mobile app for on-the-go access to the dashboard.
Safety Alerts: Automatic alerts for high-risk scenarios based on data patterns.
