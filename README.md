## üåü Overview

The **Smart Traffic System** processes and visualizes traffic data, identifying objects such as cars, pedestrians, and cyclists along with their confidence levels at specific timestamps. The system‚Äôs insights can be used for:
- **Safety Laws**: Highlighting high-risk areas and peak traffic times.
- **Urban Planning**: Optimizing pedestrian infrastructure and traffic signals.
- **Activity Analysis**: Identifying trends for public safety or events.
- **Scalable Applications**: Supporting real-time monitoring for smart cities.

This project highlights how technology can provide actionable insights, making it valuable for governments, companies, and urban planners.
